# About (What is vpm?)
vpm is a simple to use, daily-driver enhancement to the awesome XBPS (X Binary Package System), initially designed as a helper tool for use with VoidLinux. Feel free to think "Void Package Management" or something if it helps you remember its name, but please note that it's NOT a "package manager" in the nitpickers understanding of the word - especially vpm shouldn't be confused with XBPS - vpm is just an addon helper tool for XBPS to make your life easier. That's it.

# Okay, great, but why re-invent the wheel, dude!?
I personally think I don't, XBPS is hard to use and has a heavy learning curve thanks to its diversed toolchain and hard to remember commandline arguments. vpm tries to help. I wrote this as a personal educational project to improve my understanding of XBPS and VoidLinux, but I hope that others find this useful, too. vpm will also always show the actual xbps commands it translates its actions to, and also display the return codes.

# ZOMG! PONIES!!111
Rainbows and unicorns, indeed. But you can easily disable all colorization and fancyness, too, to use it in scripts. All otions have human readable and easy to remember syntax, no --long-option-with-multiple-complex-words, no need to even prefix arguments with --, vpm just tries to do its best it can to understand the user.
