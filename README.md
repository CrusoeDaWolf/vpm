# About (What is vpm?)
vpm is a simple to use, daily-driver enhancement to the awesome XBPS (X Binary Package System), initially designed as a helper tool for use with VoidLinux. Feel free to think "Void Package Management" or something to remember its name, though it is NOT a package manager and shouldn't be confused with XBPS - it's an addon helper tool for XBPS to make your life easier. That's it.
